**Bar David's Projects and LeetCode Questions**

Welcome to my repository! I'm Bar David, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Technion with a focus on software. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and LeetCode questions that I've worked on during my studies.

**About Me**
I'm passionate about software development and constantly seek to expand my knowledge in this field. My projects reflect my dedication to learning and applying software engineering principles.

**Projects**:

**Branch Predictor in C++**
This project implements various branch predictors in C++. It provides solutions for different types of branch predictions, including global and local history, global and local finite state machines (FSM), and different sizes of Branch Target Buffers (BTB).

**Firewall in C++**
This project implements a firewall in C++ that verifies whether a given IP and port are in the correct range. It provides functionality to process packets and output verified IPs and ports.

**LeetCode Questions**
I've also included some LeetCode questions that I've solved as part of my learning process. These questions cover various algorithms and data structures commonly encountered in software development interviews.
