**MultiThreading Simulator in C++**
This project implements a MultiThreading simulator in C++, capable of running threads with instructions on a Blocked MultiThreading (MT) and Fine MT configuration. The simulator provides output including register states and CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) statistics.

**Features**

**1**.Implementation of a MultiThreading simulator with Blocked MT and Fine MT configurations.

**2**.Input handling for threads with instructions.

**3**.Context switch functionality.

**4**.Execution of threads using the runthread function.

**5**.Output of register states and CPI statistics.
