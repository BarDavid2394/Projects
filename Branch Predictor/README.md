Branch Predictor in C++
This project implements various branch predictors in C++.
It provides solutions for different types of branch predictions,
including global and local history, global and local finite state machines (FSM),
and different sizes of Branch Target Buffers (BTB).

Features
Initialization of the branch predictor.
Update of the branch predictor based on branch outcomes.
Prediction of branches using different predictor configurations.
Display of statistics related to branch prediction accuracy.
